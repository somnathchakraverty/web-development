					<p>Founder & Chief Executive Officer, Healthians.com, February 2015 to present.</p>
					<p>Mr. Sahni is an IT and Healthcare Marketing professional with over 14 years of experience. He ventured into the challenging healthcare industry in 2006 and his first foray into the industry was his Digital Marketing business. He has been prominent in representing India as medical tourism destination around the world during 2007-2009.</p>
					<p>In April 2014, he turned his passion for healthcare technology into Healthians.com. Having gained vast experience working in healthcare environment, he clearly understood a patient’s mindset and the latent truth that no one either wants to fall ill or visit a hospital or do anything to avoid that from happening.</p>
					<p>He firmly believed that a paradigm shift from curative to preventive and offline to online with people becoming more aware and concerned about their health will happen soon. There was not a single platform that could help screen, track and action health data to help people take an informed decision regarding choosing a right check-up from the right lab at the right price. He wanted to structure the haphazard healthcare services and the non standardized pricing in India; hence, he built Healthians.com</p>
					<p>Deepak has been awarded "Young Entrepreneur of the Year" in 2016.</p>
